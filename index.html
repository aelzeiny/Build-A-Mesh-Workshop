          Here we will be showcasing a series of common level generation
          techniques used by major gaming studios!
        </p>
        <p>
          The depicted algorithm is the Cellular-Automa Method of Procedural Level Generation <br/>
        </p>

          Play around with the tools above until you're happy with the basic
          level shape.

          100% procedural level generation can produce some interesting results,
          but most of the time we want to be able to edit our maps to perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the pencil to add floor space
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the eraser to add walls

        <h2>STEP 3:</h2>
        <h3>Drop the player on the map</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you've built a map, we have to configure the mesh for pathfinding.
          You migh think that every polygon vertex would be a pathfinding node,
          but we can optimize the number of nodes by only considering vertecies that
          are concave (innies) rather than convex (outties). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Click on the area in which the player will walk around in.
          This demonstration works best if you pick the biggest polygon

        <h2>STEP 4:</h2>
        <h3>Building the Mesh</h3>
        <p>
          Sit back and relax
        </p>

        <p>
          Green polygon verticies are optimal for pathfinding
        </p>
        <p>
          Red polygon verticies aren't necessary for pathfinding
        </p>

      <div class="step" id="step-5">
        <h2>STEP 5:</h2>
        <h3>A Fully Connected Graph</h3>
        <p>
          Using a line of site algorithm, every node is connected to every one of its neighbors.
          Move your mouse around every nook and cranny, and you'll notice that
          there are no blind spots in the mesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that you can get from any starting location to any ending location.
