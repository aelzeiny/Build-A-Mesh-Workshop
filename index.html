        <h3>Pathfinding on abstract polygons</h3>

        <p>
          Here we will be showcasing a series of common level generation
          techniques used by major gaming studios!
        </p>
        <p>
          Implementing pathfinding on grid-based maps is a fairly basic task.
          However, real-world spaces are hardly ever so orthogonal or straight-forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implementing pathfinding on concave (abstract) polygons is a much more difficult
          task. This project will hopefully demystify some common practices that developers
          use in the industry.
        </p>

          Sound complicated? Don't worry. Here's a penguin.

          100% procedural level generation can produce some interesting results,
          but most of the time we want to be able to edit our maps to perfection.

          Use the pencil to add floor space

        <h3>Drop the player on the map</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you've built a map, we have to configure the mesh for pathfinding.
          You migh think that every polygon vertex would be a pathfinding node,
          but we can optimize the number of nodes by only considering vertecies that
          are concave (innies) rather than convex (outties). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Click on the area in which the player will walk around in.
          This demonstration works best if you pick the biggest polygon

        <p>
          Sit back and relax
        </p>

        <p>
          Green polygon verticies are optimal for pathfinding
        </p>
        <p>
          Red polygon verticies aren't necessary for pathfinding
        </p>

      <div class="step" id="step-5">
        <h2>STEP 5:</h2>
        <h3>A Fully Connected Graph</h3>
        <p>
          Using a line of site algorithm, every node is connected to every one of its neighbors.
          Move your mouse around every nook and cranny, and you'll notice that
          there are no blind spots in the mesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that you can get from any starting location to any ending location.
